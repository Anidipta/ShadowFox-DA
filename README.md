## Task 3

Dogs exhibit remarkable adaptability to apartment living, a trend poised to gain even more traction in the future. Their ability to thrive in confined spaces stems from factors like size, temperament, and energy level. Small to medium-sized breeds with calm demeanors and lower energy requirements are particularly well-suited for apartment life. As urbanization continues, breeders may increasingly focus on producing dogs tailored for apartment living, while cities might integrate more pet-friendly amenities into urban landscapes. Additionally, advancements in technology may offer innovative solutions for pet care in apartments, from indoor monitoring systems to virtual training programs. With a growing emphasis on sustainability and community engagement, the future holds promise for enhancing the well-being of dogs in apartment environments, fostering a harmonious coexistence between pets and their urban-dwelling companions.And for that an analysis is also made.
